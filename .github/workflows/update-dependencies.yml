            ## ðŸ“¦ Dependency Lock Files Update

            This PR updates the dependency lock files to reflect the latest compatible versions.

            ### Changes
            - Updated `requirements-lock.txt` from `pyproject.toml`
            - Updated `requirements-dev-lock.txt` from `requirements-dev.txt` and `pyproject.toml`

            ### What triggers this?
            - **Weekly schedule**: Runs every Monday to catch new dependency releases
            - **Manual trigger**: Can be run on-demand via workflow dispatch
            - **Requirement changes**: When `pyproject.toml` or `requirements-dev.txt` are modified

            ### Review checklist
            - [ ] Check for any breaking changes in updated dependencies
            - [ ] Verify CI tests pass with new versions
            - [ ] Review security scan results (if available)
